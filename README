Lib-touchatag-1.0 is a library developed in order to use Touchatag RFId Readers (http://www.touchatag.com) with Linux based systems. By now, only MIFIRE ULTRALIGHT tags can be used.

To succeed in using it you need to stop pcsc deamon (sudo /etc/init.d/pcscd stop).

You have to run it with the "sudo" prefix (in order to comunicate with the usb interface).


*****************
Available samples
*****************

- main_reader_info: detects all the readers connected and prints out all the available info.

- main_reader_blink: detects all the readers connected and blinks their leds.

- main_polling_all: detects all the readers and looks for tags, printing reader ID, tag UID and DATA.

Run them as: "sudo ./main_reader_info",  "sudo ./main_reader_blink" or "sudo ./main_polling_all".



The maximum number of readers that can be used "at the same time" is 10.

Read the Doxygen documentation to know all about the library and its functions.

...work in progress!
