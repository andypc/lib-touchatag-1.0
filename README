Lib-touchatag-1.0 is a library developed in order to use Touchatag RFId Readers (http://www.touchatag.com) with Linux based systems.

By now, only MIFIRE ULTRALIGHT tags can be used.

To success using it you need to stop pcsc deamon (sudo /etc/init.d/pcscd stop).

The maximum number of readers that can be used "at the same time" is 10.

Read the Doxygen documentation to know all about the library and its functions.

...work in progress!
